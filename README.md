This project is made to be used with my website

https://badpico.glitch.me

Everything in this repo is kinda weird with the way it's build, I'm new to this kind of community. It's also in a weird format, made specificly for the website, so for the best experience, I'd reccomend checking out the website.

Theres also a local download over there in the releases, it's local so it's not really reccomended, but it's the closest to open-source this thing'll every get.

Thanks,
